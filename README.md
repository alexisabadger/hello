# I am Alex McIntire
I am a software developer, computer science student, and board gamer. I am currently working on a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Oregon State University. I'm also working as a software developer at a small company in Reno, NV. I am interested in full-stack web development, machine learning, and data science.


## Welcome to my website. Here, you will find an overview of my work and interests.

Right now, I'm testing which folder the script is dropping stuff into on my host...
